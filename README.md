The DriverPass project focused on creating a system that helps students prepare for their driving tests by offering online learning materials, scheduling options for driving lessons, and progress tracking. The client, DriverPass, wanted a reliable and user-friendly platform that could handle lesson scheduling, student management, and test preparation resources while maintaining security and efficiency. I think I did particularly well in outlining the system’s structure and identifying key user interactions, such as account creation, scheduling lessons, and accessing course packages. I also made sure the proposed features aligned with the client’s goal of improving student success rates and streamlining communication between instructors and students.

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve my UML diagrams to better visualize system workflows and relationships. Adding more detailed interactions—like data validation and error handling—would make the design more comprehensive. When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on ensuring accessibility, efficiency, and simplicity. Understanding the user’s perspective is crucial because it ensures the system is intuitive and meets real-world expectations, which directly impacts user satisfaction and adoption. In future projects, I’d approach software design using iterative methods like Agile to continuously refine the system based on feedback. I’d also use techniques such as user stories, data flow diagrams, and prototypes to ensure every design decision supports the user’s goals and the client’s vision.
